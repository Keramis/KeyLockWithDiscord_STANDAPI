# KeyLockWithDiscord_STANDAPI
KeyLockWithDiscord. Everything is explained with comments, but basically, you can now lock lua scripts behind a webhook that goes through discord.
Please do note that this will require **obfuscation**, as it is trivially easy to just grab the features without it.
***Obfuscated scripts are not permitted to share publicly***, so this is only useful if you want to share this with a couple of friends, but dont want them to spread it.
